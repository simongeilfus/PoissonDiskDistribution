## Poisson Disk Distribution

This was originally written for [Grove](https://github.com/simongeilfus/GroveApp) and will probably be turned into a cinder block at some point with proper documentation and samples.
In the meantime it should be straightforward to use and should work with any recent version of [Cinder](https:://libcinder.org).

 This is based on the algorithm from [Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in Arbitrary Dimensions by Robert Bridson](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf) as explained in [this article](http://devmag.org.za/2009/05/03/poisson-disk-sampling/)
